This book is not just a book; it is a wake-up call.
Hill, a journalist at The New York Times, investigates the rise of Clearview AI, a company that scraped billions of images from the internet to build a powerful facial recognition tool. Starting with how incorrect image classification affected innocent lives, she explores the broader societal impact of deploying such technology without robust safeguards.

The book details how this technology challenges our notions of privacy and consent, raising urgent questions about the ethical use of AI and exposing the risks of unchecked surveillance.
She also provides an engaging review of the history of image recognition and visual classification tasks, even before the rise of AI, which is especially interesting for people in the field.

Hill then discusses the ethical concerns of having facial recognition systems in place, including their access to data people share with the government, on social media, or even images shared of them without their knowledge. She questions the validity of governments having these tools at their disposal and their effect on people's lives.

She also highlights the existing bias in these services. By following the people behind Clearview and sharing the stories of the victims affected by their services, Hill brings human stories to our attention and emphasizes the bias and other harms hidden in these technologies. This prompts us to consider the main question we should ask ourselves before using or creating any new technology: "Just because a technology is possible, should it be built? Clearview answered 'yes' without hesitation, forcing the rest of us to struggle with the fallout."

> **Personal Reflection**

I think reading this book is a must. It makes you unsettled, yet informed and alert. The stories and analysis presented by Hill encourage readers to critically evaluate the impact of AI technologies on society and personal privacy. This book is essential for anyone interested in the intersection of technology, ethics, and human rights.
*Your Face Belongs to Us* is a powerful, necessary read. It exposes the hidden players shaping a future where anonymity might be impossible.

> **Spoiler alert:**
Are you interested in political campaigns and their background? This book reveals some connections between Clearview founders and US election campaigns in 2016.
